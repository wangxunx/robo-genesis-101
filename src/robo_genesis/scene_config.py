# Domain randomization (DR) of object color is deliberately constrained to each object's
# *real-world* appearance distribution, so recolored objects stay physically plausible
# (a banana may drift yellow <-> yellow-green for ripeness, but never turns black/blue).
#
# Sampling happens in HSV -- hue in degrees [0, 360), saturation/value in [0, 1] -- because
# the natural variation of these objects is a narrow band on the hue axis plus a
# value/saturation range, which is awkward to express in RGB. A value *floor* keeps
# objects from going implausibly dark.
#
# Only objects with an entry here get recolored (and only when object-color DR is turned
# on); everything else keeps its original mesh texture. The bowl is a container, not a
# grasp target, so its color is a task-irrelevant nuisance and its band is left wide.
# Consumed by ``build_scene`` when ``SceneDomainRandomizationConfig.randomize_object_color``.

# so matching D435i means picking the right resolution aspect ratio + vertical FOV.
#
# Used as an RGB-only camera (depth channel ignored), matched to the D435i *color*
# module spec: FOV 69 deg (H) x 42 deg (V), native 16:9 sensor.
# Using vfov = 42 deg at 1280x720 reproduces the horizontal FOV automatically:
