"""Scripted pick-and-place, parameterized via TaskSpec.

Reuses build_scene() from build_scene.py. The robot performs a scripted
pick-and-place state machine using IK + motion planning + force-controlled grasp.

A task is described by a `TaskSpec` (what to pick, where to place, success
tolerance). Per-object grasp behavior is described by a `GraspProfile`.

Examples:
    # pick the banana and place it into the bowl (default)
    uv run python -m robo_genesis.grasp_demo --cpu --save-frames

    # pick the mug and place it onto a tabletop coordinate
    uv run python -m robo_genesis.grasp_demo --cpu --pick 025_mug --place 0.5,0.2
