"""Policy-agnostic closed-loop evaluation of a trained lerobot policy.

Runs a trained policy (ACT, SmolVLA, or any other lerobot policy) in the same
Genesis pick-and-place scene used for recording, and reports the success rate.

The script is deliberately *policy-agnostic*: it never hard-codes ACT- or
SmolVLA-specific logic. Instead it relies on lerobot's generic interfaces, and
is organized as a few thin layers:

  1. Policy layer   -- load any checkpoint via ``PreTrainedConfig`` + ``make_policy``
                       + ``make_pre_post_processors``. The only per-policy detail
                       (normalization, image resize, temporal ensembling, language
                       conditioning) lives inside the loaded processors/policy.
  2. Observation    -- ``build_observation`` reads the sim into the exact feature
     layer            keys the dataset used (state + camera images), as raw numpy.
                       ``predict_action`` (lerobot) then converts/normalizes them.
  3. Action layer   -- the policy emits the dataset's action vector (9-D joint
                       targets); ``apply_action`` position-controls the arm+gripper.
  4. Rollout layer  -- ``run_episode`` steps the sim, decimating the 100 Hz control
                       loop down to the policy's fps, and checks task success.

The dataset the policy was trained on is used only to recover feature shapes,
normalization stats and fps (via ``LeRobotDatasetMetadata``); no episodes are read.

Usage:
    uv run python -m robo_genesis.eval_policy \
        --policy-path outputs/train/act_banana/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model \
        --repo-id genesis/banana_pick \
        --dataset-root datasets/banana_pick \
        --episodes 20 --pick 011_banana

    # SmolVLA is identical -- only the checkpoint changes:
    uv run python -m robo_genesis.eval_policy \
        --policy-path outputs/train/smolvla_banana/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model \
        --repo-id genesis/banana_pick --dataset-root .../banana_pick --episodes 20
